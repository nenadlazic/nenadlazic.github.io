  <h1 class="top-h1">How to write release notes</h1>
  <p class="mb-1">August 10, 2025</p>
  <p>&mdash;</p>

<div class="content">
  <p>Release notes are one of the most underrated tools in software development. Often overlooked, they can be a powerful way to communicate changes, ensure smoother deployments, and build trust across teams - and even with users.</p>
<p>In this post, we‚Äôll walk through:</p>
<ul>
<li>What release notes are (and what they‚Äôre not)</li>
<li>When and why to write them</li>
<li>Who benefits from them</li>
<li>What a good release note should contain</li>
<li>A practical example &amp; reusable template</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re running a microservice architecture or a monolith, releasing internal tools or public APIs - this guide is for you.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-release-notes">What are release notes?</h2>
<p>Release notes are formal, structured summaries that communicate what has changed in a specific version of a software product. Typically tied to a version number (e.g. v1.3.0), they provide visibility into new features, bug fixes, improvements, and any known limitations or risks introduced with the release.</p>
<p>Although often confused with changelogs, release notes serve a different purpose. Changelogs are usually auto-generated and list raw commits or pull requests. Release notes are carefully written documents that provide context, summarize key updates, and help product managers, developers, QA, support teams, and clients understand what was delivered and why it matters.</p>
<h2 id="when-and-why-to-write-them">When and why to write them?</h2>
<p>Release notes should be written before or at the time of deployment, not days later when details are blurred.
They are not just a formality, they serve several purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication across teams - everyone from developers to support staff knows exactly what changed</li>
<li>Documentation - they create a historical record of releases for audits, troubleshooting, and onboarding new team members</li>
<li>Expectation setting - they prepare users for upcoming changes, reducing surprises and confusion</li>
<li>Risk mitigation - highlighting known issues or special instructions can prevent production incidents</li>
</ul>
<p>Even for internal tools, skipping release notes often results in confusion, duplicate bug reports, or wasted time rediscovering changes.</p>
<h2 id="who-benefits-from-release-notes">Who benefits from release notes?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Developers - understand dependencies, breaking changes, and feature availability</li>
<li>QA/testers - know what to test and where to focus regression checks</li>
<li>Support teams - can answer user questions quickly without digging through code or tickets</li>
<li>Product managers - get a clear view of delivered value and project progress</li>
<li>End users/clients - can see improvements, new capabilities, and changes that affect them directly</li>
</ul>
<p>Good release notes are written with all these audiences in mind. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to write five different versions but you should balance technical detail with plain language explanations.</p>
<h2 id="what-a-good-release-note-should-contain">What a good release note should contain?</h2>
<p>While the exact format can vary depending on your team and product, a well-written release note usually includes:</p>
<h3 id="-release-info">üì¶ Release Info</h3>
<p>Basic information about the release that helps identify the exact version deployed and its source in the code repository.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="-summary">üîç Summary</h3>
<p>A brief high-level overview highlighting the key changes in this release, giving readers a quick understanding of what‚Äôs new or improved.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="-product-features">‚ú® Product Features</h3>
<p>User-facing features or enhancements that improve functionality or add new capabilities.</p>
<h3 id="-technical-features">‚öôÔ∏è Technical Features</h3>
<p>Backend or infrastructure changes relevant to developers and operations teams, such as new APIs or monitoring improvements.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="-resolved-support-tickets">‚úÖ Resolved Support Tickets</h3>
<p>Specific user or support issues addressed in this release, providing transparency on customer-impacting fixes.</p>
<h3 id="-bug-fixes">üêõ Bug Fixes</h3>
<p>Detailed list of bugs fixed with concise descriptions to inform users and maintainers.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="-breaking-changes">‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes</h3>
<p>Important changes that may require users or integrators to update their workflows or configurations.</p>
<h3 id="-known-issues">‚ùó Known Issues</h3>
<p>Current limitations or problems users should be aware of, including possible workarounds if available.</p>
<h3 id="-deployment-notes">üöÄ Deployment Notes</h3>
<p>Instructions necessary to successfully deploy and run this release, including environment variables, database migrations and etc.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="-compatibility">üß© Compatibility</h3>
<p>Compatibility information with other services or versions helps users plan upgrades and avoid integration issues.</p>
<p>Including a compatibility matrix can be especially helpful. It is a simple table listing which versions of your software work with which versions of dependent services, libraries, or platforms.</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Component</th>
          <th>Compatible Versions</th>
          <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>Transcoder service</td>
          <td>‚â• 1.4.0</td>
          <td>Required for retry features</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Packaging service</td>
          <td>2.0.1 - 2.3.5</td>
          <td>Deprecated versions unsupported</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Database</td>
          <td>PostgreSQL 12 or higher</td>
          <td>Older versions not tested</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>This helps users quickly verify if their environment matches the release requirements, reducing upgrade risks.</p>
